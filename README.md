# HumanNeRF

This repo primarily implements the Human-NeRF model by Weng et al. and elaborates on creating a custom dataset for training on Human-NeRF.<br/>
The custom dataset preparation includes various methods such as Grounding DINO for detecting bounding boxes, Segment-Anything (SAM) for generating binary masks, VIBE for estimating human pose and shape. The dataset is then processed to train the Human-NeRF model, which is generated by integrating the outputs of all the aforementioned methods.<br/>

**A detailed instructive README file will be provided soon.**

This project is developed as a coursework-project for the **IMT4392 Deep Learning for Visual Computing** in the **Computational Color and Spectral Imaging (COSI)** masters program.
